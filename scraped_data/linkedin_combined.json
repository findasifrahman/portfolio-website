You need to have Open AI tier-2 access to handle the request efficiently. Declare Website Name and entity name that you want to scrap in the code and run the code.You will also need Firecrawl, Langsmith and OPENAI API key.GPT-4o performs very well with this agent.You can choos between GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo or GPT-3.5.
