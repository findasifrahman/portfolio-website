NASA Robotic Mining Competition is for university -level students to design and build \na mining robot that can traverse the simulated Martian chaotic terrain, excavate Martian \nregolith and deposit the regolith into a Collector Bin within 10 minutes.  \n2. The tech nology concepts developed by the university teams for this competition \nconceivably could be used to robotically mine regolith resources on Mars . \n3. NASA will directly benefit from the competition by encouraging the development of \ninnovative robotic excavation concepts from universities which may result in clever \nideas and solutions which could be applied to an actual excavation device or payload.  \n4. The complexities of the challenge include the abrasive characteristics of the basaltic \nregolith simulant,  the weight and size limitations of the mining robot, and the ability to \ntele-operate it from a remote mission control center.  \n5. The competition is conducted by NASA at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The \nteams that can use telerobotic or autonomous ope ration to excavate the basaltic regolith \nsimulant, called Black Point -1 or BP -1, and score the most points wins the Joe Kosmo \nAward for Excellence.  \n6. BRAC University under Dr. Khalilur Rahman has qualified for the NASA LMC 2011 \nand participated in the compet ition as the first team ever to venture at NASA from \nBangladesh.  \n7.
